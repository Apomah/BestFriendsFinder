    <string name="about">For over 30 years, Best Friends Animal Society has been running the nationâ€™s largest no-kill sanctuary for companion animals and building effective programs that reduce the number of animals entering shelters.</string>
    <string name="about1">Our mission is to bring about a time when there are No More Homeless Pets. One of the ways we\'re working towards this is streamlining the adoption process for people looking for new best friends. This app is part of that effort.</string>
